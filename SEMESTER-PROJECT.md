# Semester Term Project Description

## Purpose
The purpose of this modeling project is for you to explore an existing model of interest to your professional development and/or research. 

## Description and Overview
During this project you will: 

1. Select a model for further study, 
2. Examine key details of the Earth and environmental processes that it models in the context of topics we cover in the class,
3. Review the required data needed to set up initial and boundary conditions for the model,
4. Investigate procedures and data needs for calibration/validation, and 
5. Design a numerical experiment to test a scientific hypothesis or perform a specific analysis. 

Note: ___You will not need to setup, run, or perform your numerical experiment as a requirement of the project.___ However, this project could be a valuable tool to kickstart any modeling activities required for your thesis or dissertation. As such, I ___highly___ encourage you to consult with your advisor(s) and me when choosing a model. 

## Requirements
This project will be submitted as a Markdown (e.g., `PROJECT.md`) file in your GitHub repository for the class.
